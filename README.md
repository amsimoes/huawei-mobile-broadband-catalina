# Huawei Mobile Broadband - 4g LTE USB Modem Driver (64bits - MacOS Catalina)

Sharing this driver after spending 1 hour looking for a compatible driver - the one on USB package content wasn't 64-bit compatible as MacOS Catalina requires.

Found it on some website or forums I can't remember as I trial/error quite a few of them.

My USB LTE Modem is Huawei E392 (E392u-12) but might work with other Huawei USB stick models.

# Instructions

1. Unzip the file and run "MobileWifi_Driver" (right-click "Open")
2. At the middle of setup you'll have to allow the installation from "unsafe source"
3. Once completed, three new Network Interfaces will show up "HUAWEI-Mobile (1,2,3)"
4. Press "HUAWEI-Mobile1" (or any other, will work too)
5. Input "\*99#" on Telephone Number
6. Press Connect
7. Done
